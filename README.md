## Updating the repository

Please view the private README set up by previous webmasters (if you do not have access to it, reach out to previous webmasters). For organizational purposes, each semester's version is saved as a separate branch under the semester's name. For example, to look at the Fall 2017 version of the website, simply checkout the `fa17` branch. When developing for future semesters, please follow this notation.
