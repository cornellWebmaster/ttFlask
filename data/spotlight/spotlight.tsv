ETePwxgj	Alumnus Spotlight: Omar Abdul-Rahim	"I joined Theta Tau to find the sense of community and fulfillment within the College of Engineering that I was unable to find within my studies alone," says Omar. Hear from Cornell Theta Tau's alumnus about his experience at Cornell and in Theta Tau.	abdul-rahim_01.jpg	Alumnus Spotlight		In August of 2015, I arrived at Cornell pretty unsure of what I wanted to study. I had declared Materials Science as my intended major, primarily because I had no idea what it was, but I ruled it out as an option soon after my first ENGRI. By the end of a confusing freshman year, I decided to pick a major and just stick with it (that major being Operations Research and Information Engineering). Now, I don’t mean to say that I didn’t find value in this wonderful field of study - in fact, many of the theory courses are what made me not regret staying in the College of Engineering at all. However, I knew I wouldn’t be able to withstand even a day in one of the full-time jobs that ORIE majors tend to fill.	I joined Theta Tau to find the sense of community and fulfillment within the College of Engineering that I was unable to find within my studies alone. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to get to know so many interesting and passionate people as well as I have. I love hearing about the lives and involvements of my Brothers, stories always told with so much depth of knowledge and enthusiasm, and I have always felt encouraged by the interest paid to the stories I tell. It was largely the support of my fellow members that gave me the confidence to pursue a professional opportunity that I love (product design at a startup in Nevada) rather than several that might be more typical of someone in my field of study. No matter where I go, I know that I can count on TT to have my back.	On another note, I’d like to say how proud I am of the significant inclusivity efforts the members of Theta Tau have accomplished so far. We, like all professional fraternities, have a history of problematic exclusion, but great and hardworking people within Theta Tau are working to confront that history and make changes that prevent us from ever returning to such practices. When I joined about two years ago, conversations about rush and education process inclusivity weren’t being had in any significant way. Now, members are educating each other about the variety of experiences within Theta Tau’s membership, questioning the ethics behind long-standing institutional practices, and reaching out to outside affinity organizations for added perspective. There is still a lot of work to do in this realm, but I am confident that with the enthusiasm to learn that I’ve seen from all our members and with our excellent D&I leadership (shoutout Celine Choo), the progress we see will continue to be great.							
4nLQPAfJ	Brother Spotlight: Kara Guse	Kara, a current graduate student and Cornell Theta Tau alumnus, talks about her path to pursuing a Master’s of Public Administration after obtaining a Bachelor's in Materials Science and Engineering.	guse_01.jpg	Brother Spotlight		When I joined Theta Tau, I was a sophomore within Materials Science & Engineering. What attracted me most to the organization was that all of the individual members had a coherent story to tell; everyone had a defined goal and were making the most of their time at Cornell to bring it to fruition. As a very lost undergraduate, I desired to have that same direction in my own life. Through the New Member Education program, the most valuable lesson I learned was how to look for the best resources. I gained insight on how to reach out to recruiters & professors, how to make the most of my curriculum, and how to be a leader in my field of interest. Moreover, my Brothers gave me the confidence to pursue anything that I set my career upon no matter how intangible it may seem to my major. 	This became invaluable when I decided to pursue a Master’s of Public Administration here at Cornell. I was fortunate enough to secure a full time job in October of my senior year, but I remember feeling doubts on working for a corporation. Throughout my 4 years in undergrad I also pursued a minor in International Relations. From this minor, I was exposed to how development in underprivileged nations is not as rosy as the West wants us to think; it is still rife with inequality, extreme property, and exploitation. As a proud Cambodian American, I thought about how my own country of origin was doing in this age of globalization. It broke my heart when I started becoming more involved in Cambodian politics and realized it still suffers from authoritarianism, extreme deforestation, human trafficking, worker exploitation in sweatshops, and other vices that come with development. 	In April of my senior year, I made the bold decision that I would work to change the development paradigm in Cambodia and overall Southeast Asia.  I was applying to a Master’s program within the last 3 weeks of school left. I was scared to say the least. Not only was I unsure if I could create a compelling application in only 3 weeks, but also on if I could afford the program. Regardless, my Brothers gave me support and advice during the entire process. No one ever told me my goals were too hard to achieve. They pushed me to reach out to professors in the program, read and revised my statement of purpose probably over 50 times, and gave me words of encouragement every day. 	Fast forward to Slope Day (yes, Slope Day), I received an email in my inbox. I was accepted to Cornell’s Institute for Public Affairs (CIPA) on a full scholarship.	Without my support network in Theta Tau, I would have never had the confidence to apply to CIPA or had the appropriate materials to qualify for a full scholarship. The Brothers helped me when I was an engineer and helped me still when I desired to work in the field of government & policy. Today, I absolutely love my program and the network I am building outside of engineering. I can never thank the Brotherhood enough for getting me to where I am today. 					
FgIfjgVL	Alumnus Spotlight: Katrina Lastra	"I make bad puns and then laugh at myself almost always," says Katrina. Hear from Cornell Theta Tau's alumnus and previous Vice Regent about her experience at Cornell and in Theta Tau.	lastra_01.jpg	alumnus spotlight		Before coming to Cornell I had a plan to become a biomedical engineer, to delve into cancer research, and to work on the next greatest medical device. By the end of my freshman year this had all changed and I soon felt like I had no idea what I wanted to do with my time here. I switched to mechanical engineering at the beginning of my sophomore year and struggled to find the excitement in my major. Come the Spring semester I attended a TT information session and by the end of the week I was accepted into the Kappa pledge class. It wasn't until I had the chance to talk to all of these brothers, ranging all year and all majors, that I was able to learn more about who I was and what I wanted to do with my degree. Over that semester I gained significantly more confidence in myself to become a better leader, engineer, and person. 	By my junior year I had become the President of SHPE on campus and eventually the Vice Regent of Theta Tau. Though this may all sound like a humble brag, I say this solely because without the help of the people I have met through TT I would not have built up the confidence and desire to become someone who exceeded my own expectations of myself. 	Although I have since graduated from Cornell with a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, I can confidently write that it definitely was not the major for me. I struggled and I failed (a lot), but I know that at the end of these long 3 and a half years, that every decision I have made has been entirely worthwhile. Being a part of this brotherhood has enabled me to give back and help those who were struggling in the same exact ways in which I was just a few years ago. Yet the most rewarding part of all of this is seeing how I have grown and developed as a person far more than I could have ever imagined I would. 							
wXY7dlep	Announcement Regarding Diversity	On behalf of the Kappa Delta chapter, former Regent Jordan Fuller speaks about the importance of diversity and inclusion to the organization. Discrimination and hate speech should never be tolerated.	brotherhood_pic_s17.jpg	a message from a former regent	-- Jordan Fuller, Regent of Kappa Delta Chapter	We are the brothers of the Kappa Delta Chapter of Theta Tau at Cornell University. We condemn the behaviors demonstrated in the recently released video from our chapter at Syracuse University, and do not feel that this is representative of who we are as a professional engineering fraternity. We support the investigation of the chapter by our national officers and hope that this incident can serve as a teaching opportunity for those who would use such hateful language in any way.	Unfortunately, it is not within our legal capacity to comment on the situation at this time. That being said, the Kappa Delta Chapter wants to emphasize that we will do everything in our ability to ensure that hate speech and acts of discrimination do not proliferate within the Cornell Engineering community. Furthermore, the Kappa Delta Chapter has reached out to Theta Tau Nationals to request that they publish diversity statistics and create an action plan to prevent similar acts from taking place.	We have already started taking large steps towards improving diversity within our own chapter. Over the past semester, we have held intensive diversity and consent education workshops to raise awareness around issues within the community. Additionally, we have analyzed our recruitment statistics in an attempt to target unconscious bias within the recruitment process. These are some of the initial steps that we have taken to educate and ensure that every member of the chapter is an agent of change and a social justice ally. Under no circumstance shall the members of our chapter insinuate or tolerate any behaviors endangering the campus climate or the well-being of our peers. As regent of Theta Tau, I can ensure that we will continue to cultivate a positive and inclusive community over the next year and beyond.	Although we are not currently at liberty to make any public comments, we encourage you to reach out to discuss how the behaviors demonstrated by the chapter at Syracuse University have affected you. As individuals, our opinions on the matter cannot be silenced, and we are here to listen.						
V5i0iToN	Brother Spotlight: Chris Wright	Have you ever set up dominoes to topple them over? Chris, currently Academics Chair, designs and builds with dominoes in elaborate ways.	clinch_01.jpg	brother spotlight		In sixth grade, I received a set of wooden dominoes for my birthday. I wanted to learn as much as I could about how I could set them up and what the possibilities were with simple pieces. When I looked on YouTube I found a trove of videos showcasing thousands of dominoes placed into intricate structures and pictures. I was very inspired by all of what I saw and I attempted to mimic the things I found to be the most interesting such as pictures and 3-D pyramids. I decided to make my own YouTube channel solely as a way to watch the things I had built fall again and to share my creations with my family. Over time, I connected with other domino builders through YouTube and I quickly learned a ton about domino building techniques, videography, and video editing.	In high school I started focusing less on YouTube and more on group events and freelance work because I was much more passionate about working with others than just myself in my basement. I have been very lucky to have been able to join other domino builders from around the world in many exciting events. Two of my proudest domino accomplishments are appearing on The Today Show and helping build 250,000 dominoes for the American domino toppling record.	My absolute favorite thing to do is to imagine some complex domino setup, then to start designing and building it and diagnose problems along the way. Meeting all of the engineers in Theta Tau has taught me a similar motivational lesson. Through this brotherhood I have witnessed and heard of so many success stories, as well as many failures and lessons they have learned. I have widely broadened my horizons being in Theta Tau and I have received so much guidance and help to help me make my dreams into realities. Domino building for me is a passion that I want to always be involved with, and Theta Tau has encouraged me to focus on these passions, as well as guide me to my professional interests in product design and manufacturing.
