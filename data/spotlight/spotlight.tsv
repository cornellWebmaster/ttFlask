FgIfjgVL	Alumnus Spotlight: Katrina Lastra	"I make bad puns and then laugh at myself almost always," says Katrina. Hear from Cornell Theta Tau's alumnus and previous Vice Regent about her experience at Cornell and in Theta Tau.	lastra_01.jpg	brother spotlight		Before coming to Cornell I had a plan to become a biomedical engineer, to delve into cancer research, and to work on the next greatest medical device. By the end of my freshman year this had all changed and I soon felt like I had no idea what I wanted to do with my time here. I switched to mechanical engineering at the beginning of my sophomore year and struggled to find the excitement in my major. Come the Spring semester I attended a TT information session and by the end of the week I was accepted into the Kappa pledge class. It wasn't until I had the chance to talk to all of these brothers, ranging all year and all majors, that I was able to learn more about who I was and what I wanted to do with my degree. Over that semester I gained significantly more confidence in myself to become a better leader, engineer, and person. 	By my junior year I had become the President of SHPE on campus and eventually the Vice Regent of Theta Tau. Though this may all sound like a humble brag, I say this solely because without the help of the people I have met through TT I would not have built up the confidence and desire to become someone who exceeded my own expectations of myself. 	Although I have since graduated from Cornell with a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, I can confidently write that it definitely was not the major for me. I struggled and I failed (a lot), but I know that at the end of these long 3 and a half years, that every decision I have made has been entirely worthwhile. Being a part of this brotherhood has enabled me to give back and help those who were struggling in the same exact ways in which I was just a few years ago. Yet the most rewarding part of all of this is seeing how I have grown and developed as a person far more than I could have ever imagined I would. 							
V5i0iToN	Brother Spotlight: Andrea Clinch	What is it like choosing between engineering and premed? Andrea, previously the Regent of Theta Tau, talks about what it was like to balance two demanding academic/professional schedules.	clinch_01.jpg	brother spotlight		I became interested in medicine early on in high school when I traveled to Peru for a medical mission trip to fix cleft lips and palettes. I was always planning on being pre-med, but I felt that I didn't have enough personal experience to lock myself into a strictly pre-med major. Instead, I chose to major in (biological) engineering, assuming either engineering or premed would 'win out' as my top passion and I would drop the other. Now, as a senior still in engineering and preparing to apply to medical school, it's obvious I never chose just one of these passions. Before joining Theta Tau, I felt split between my interests. I felt like it was required that I drop this "random combination" and focus on just one. When I pledged, the more I talked with brothers the more I realized that engineering is not a strictly defined field. You can use an engineering degree to fit any and all of your passions. With every brother who told me their unconventional plan for how to use engineering in their career, I saw my own path changing. Theta Tau not only showed me that I can prioritize both engineering and medicine but also provided the support for me to do this. From taking finals to taking the MCAT, my success is owed in large part to this group and all it has to offer.
