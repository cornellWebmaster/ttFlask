Jordan	Fuller		Regent	Jordan is a junior from Tampa, FL studying Chemical Engineering.	Last summer Jordan worked at 3M doing research and development in their Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division. In the past, Jordan worked at Goldman Sachs in Global Investment Research.	In addition to being the regent of Theta Tau, Jordan takes pride in being a part of the best demographic on campus, the women of Mu. On campus, Jordan is the junior team captain of ChemE Car, a junior rep for AICHE, and on the recruiting team for Cayuga's Watchers. Additionally she researches in the DeLisa lab, where she works on engineering antibodies to recognize carbohydrate antigens.	In her free time, Jordan enjoys sleeping, doing yoga late at night in Duffield, crocheting scarves, and craft nights with the womMus.				jlf323
Jinghan	Zhang		Vice Regent	Jinghan is a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in English. She hopes to go to medical school and specialize in reconstructive surgery, but also believes that it is foolish to have hopes.	For the past few summers, Jinghan hasn't stepped foot out of Ithaca because she lives in her research laboratory. This past summer was especially titillating because she studied for the MCAT and turned into a hermit, but without any of the advantages, such as leading a carefree existence.	On campus, Jinghan works in the Brito Lab, where she grows bacteria, which is as delectable as it sounds. She is a TA for BIOMG 3300. Additionally, she is the Structures Lead for Design Build Fly, a project team that designs, builds, and flies airplanes. Very self-explanatory. Finally, Jinghan is the Vice Regent and New Member Educator of Theta Tau.	Jinghan doesn’t know how to have fun, nor does she have the time, so she doesn’t know what else to write in this blurb. The End.				jz569

Mabel	Lawrence		Scribe	Don't let the engineering degree fool you: Mabel has spent the past two summers as a carpentry intern building scenery for theater productions. Mabel is pursuing an independent major in mechanical engineering and theater, and hopes to find a career as a set designer merging technology and the arts.	On campus, she is involved with Cornell Outdoor Education and Medium Design Collective. For a fun time, ask Mabel about her love of pups, travel, or food.						ml935
