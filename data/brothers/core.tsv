Sophia	Oguri		Regent	Sophia is a sophomore from Pasadena, California studying Operations Research and Information Engineering and pursuing a minor in Design and Environmental Analysis.	On campus, she is the battery team lead for the Cornell ChemE Car project team, from back when she had high aspirations to be a ChemE. She is also looking into research into how public services, driven and organized by algorithmic systems, can shape social inequalities. Her professional interests lie in understanding how data-driven public technologies affect social climates, but you may get a different answer if you ask her tomorrow."	"When she is not found hunched over a table in Upson, you can find her people watching, cooking, playing the violin, fermenting (not as weird as it sounds, she promises), watching all the Bon Appetit YouTube videos, eating all of the food in her sorority house, and missing her dog.					tso24
