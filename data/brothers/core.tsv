Jinghan	Zhang		Vice Regent	Hailing from the grand metroplis of Sugar Land, Texas, Jinghan is a junior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in English, with the intent of becoming a reconstructive surgeon.	For the past few summers, Jinghan has done research at Cornell with the hopes of publishing a paper so she can feel like her life has not been a waste. This summer, she is very excited to drop everything in her life so she can study for the MCAT. She might even forget to sleep and eat and breathe because she'll be having so much fun doing practice exams.	On campus, Jinghan works in the Brito Lab, where she grows cute bacteria to study the Microbiome. She is also a TA for BME 2010. Additionally, she is the Structures Lead for Design Build Fly, a project team that designs, builds, and flies airplanes. Finally, Jinghan is the vice regent of Theta Tau as the website shows.	Jinghan doesn’t know how to have fun, nor does she have the time, so she doesn’t know what else to write in this blurb. The End.				jz569
