Over the summer, Kanha interned in Bali, where he worked with a five star hotel chain to help make them zero waste to landfill. On campus, he is a sub-team lead for AguaClara and is involved in the training of retrievers and shepherds with Guiding Eyes for the Blind. Despite this, you can almost always find him in Duffield.	Kanha is big fan of coffee, which is why he’s always attempting to get people to join him on his far too frequent runs to Gimme. He often creates impromptu plans to get bubble tea with Julia and Liz, or convinces people to join him on random trips to watch movies at the Regal Cinema.				
Collin	Montag	2	Xi	Collin is a sophomore from Basking Ridge, NJ studying CS and minoring in OR. If he could, he'd also study political science, quantum physics, and theoretical math, but unfortunately having four majors isn't exactly a path to graduating.	Last summer, he worked at PVSC, an EPA water treatment facility, where he <del>cleaned the sewers</del> programmed and managed network security in their IT department.	All engineering aside, Collin loves music. He's played classical and ragtime piano for fourteen years and helps give lessons on campus through the Cornell Piano Society. He also sings with the Conell Glee Club and, as their webmaster and TT webmaster, hopes to one day completely own the internet. If you're ever looking for some good classical pieces, don't hesitate to ask!	When he's not "studying" in Duffield, you can find Collin practicing in Lincoln, working on one of his many software ventures, or devouring hummus like a fiend (he swears it's his Turkish blood). He does taekwondo and boxing and firmly believes everyone should ice skate at least once in their life. He also enjoys the company of his fellow Brothers™ and has a lot of experience dealing with Kanha, so feel free to reach out if he ever gives you any trouble.
