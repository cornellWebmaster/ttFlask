Matt	Danbury		Nu	How can the seemingly endless variety of the “stuff” that makes up your environment be explained under one unified theory? What is going on in these materials - and those yet to be discovered - at length and time scales far beyond our unaided perception? If aggregates of electrons and nuclei can give rise to both the device you are reading this on and the eyes you are reading it with, what else could we hope to innovate?

Kanha	Matai		Xi	From a land far far away, Kanha is a sophomore EnvE major. Born and raised in a country with the most diverse flora and fauna in the world, Indonesia, he has developed a passion for the environment, sustainability and nature. Thanks to long history of keeping reef aquarium, Kanha has the ability to identify many coral and fish. He’s even started comparing the Xi class to coral species. For example, Collin is a green star polyp. You can ask Collin to explain why.	Over the summer, Kanha interned in Bali, where he worked with a five star hotel chain to help make them zero waste to landfill. On campus, he is a research advisor for AguaClara and is involved in the training of retrievers and shepherds with Guiding Eyes for the Blind. Despite this, you can almost always find him in Duffield.	Kanha is big fan of coffee, which is why he’s always attempting to get people to join him for a cup of coffee from his endless collection of coffee. He often creates impromptu plans to get Gimme Coffee with Julia, Liz and Anuj, or convinces people to join him on random trips to watch movies at the Regal Cinema.			
Collin	Montag	2	Xi	Collin is a sophomore from Basking Ridge, NJ studying CS and minoring in OR. If he could, he'd also study political science, quantum physics, and theoretical math, but unfortunately having four majors isn't exactly a path to graduating.	Last summer, he worked at PVSC, an EPA water treatment facility, where he <del>cleaned the sewers</del> programmed and managed network security in their IT department.	All engineering aside, Collin loves music. He's played classical and ragtime piano for fourteen years and helps give lessons on campus through the Cornell Piano Society. He also sings with the Conell Glee Club and, as their webmaster and TT webmaster, hopes to one day completely own the internet. If you're ever looking for some good classical pieces, don't hesitate to ask!	When he's not "studying" in Duffield, you can find Collin practicing in Lincoln, working on one of his many software ventures, or devouring hummus like a fiend (he swears it's his Turkish blood). He does taekwondo and boxing and firmly believes everyone should ice skate at least once in their life. He also enjoys the company of his fellow Brothers™ and has a lot of experience dealing with Kanha, so feel free to reach out if he ever gives you any trouble.
