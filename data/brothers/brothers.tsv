Nicolas	Barone		Nu	For the longest time, my family and I believed I would be a professional tennis player. Although I come from a financially stable household, my parents recognized how costly and difficult it was to attend a top university. Due to the limited access to STEM learning opportunities at my schools and my parents having a background as athletes, they saw our best shot was to get an athletic scholarship as a collegiate tennis player. Because of this, I spent the first 15 years as an athlete first and a student second. 	But after having greater exposure to STEM in high school my family and I saw how many opportunities I had ahead if I focused on my education. I quit tennis as a junior in high school and for the first time in my life was a student first.	Ever since I realized the empowerment STEM education provides, I have been trying to increase students' access to quality STEM education.  in February 2018 I founded uniVRsity to make online STEM education more engaging for students through Virtual Reality(VR). I’m currently on a leave of absence pursuing our mission full-time and will be doing so for the next full year.
