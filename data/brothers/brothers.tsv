Celine	Choo		Nu	Celine is a sophomore from Holmdel, NJ majoring in computer science and minoring in English and linguistics.	Currently, her professional interest is in natural language processing (with 35.6% certainty). Because her passion is in writing, she is very interested in the cross between the arts/humanities and mathematical/logical thinking.	When she is not (1) attempting to write a story/poem/essay, (2) sleeping at odd hours, (3) laughing at memes (shamefully), or (4) watching Buzzf**d (also shamefully), you can find her in Carpenter basement working on Cornell Cup or pulling all-nighters working on psets she should have started three days earlier.	Engineering aside, Celine aspires to publish a book and/or write a movie/comedy screenplay in the far-off future. Also check out Google Blockly -- the project she worked on last summer!			
Matthew	Danbury		Nu	Matt is a sophomore from LaGrange, IL studying Engineering Physics and minoring in Applied Mathematics. His interests lie in novel nanostructured materials and their potential device applications. He plans to pursue a Ph.D in applied physics or materials science and a career in research and development of nanotechnologies.	On campus, Matt works in the Kourkoutis electron microscopy group, TA’s for the Department of Physics, and is a research mentor for Cornell Undergraduate Research Board. 	This past summer, Matt stayed on campus to continue his research, and reveled in the fleeting Ithaca summer warmth.	When he is not in the lab or the library, Matt can be found running or hiking a gorge trail, sustaining a zealous caffeine habit at Gimme, listening to new music artists, or preparing a gourmet meal.			
Priyanka 	Konan		Nu	Priyanka is a sophomore from Chandler, AZ studying Chemical Engineering. On campus, Priyanka is a Course Assistant for MATH 1920, an undergraduate researcher in the DeLisa Lab Group, and the Vice President of Event Planning for her social sorority. 	This past summer, Priyanka continued her research in the DeLisa Laboratory, where she worked on genetic cloning techniques to design plasmids that make up a split ubiquibody complex and dimerize in the presence of a chemical. Priyanka also worked at the CAU summer camp and taught an Engineering Sampler course for elementary schools students. 	Outside of the classroom, Priyanka enjoys petting any dog in sight, eating pineapple pizza with Erin, and hiking.				
Jared	Lim		Nu	Jared is a sophomore from Irvine, California, studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. His professional interest is algorithm complexities and artificial intelligence.
