When she is not (1) attempting to write a story/poem/essay, (2) sleeping at odd hours, (3) laughing at memes (shamefully), or (4) watching Buzzf**d (also shamefully), you can find her in Carpenter basement working on Cornell Cup or pulling all-nighters working on psets she should have started three days earlier.	Engineering aside, Celine aspires to publish a book and/or write a movie/comedy screenplay in the far-off future. Also check out Google Blockly -- the project she worked on last summer!
