Joe	Wetzel		New Member Educator
Jinghan	Zhang		New Member Educator	Jinghan is a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in English. She hopes to go to medical school and specialize in reconstructive surgery, but also believes that it is foolish to have hopes.	For the past few summers, Jinghan hasn't stepped foot out of Ithaca because she lives in her research laboratory. This past summer was especially titillating because she studied for the MCAT and turned into a hermit, but without any of the advantages, such as leading a carefree existence.	On campus, Jinghan works in the Brito Lab, where she grows bacteria, which is as delectable as it sounds. She is a TA for BIOMG 3300. Additionally, she is the Structures Lead for Design Build Fly, a project team that designs, builds, and flies airplanes. Very self-explanatory. Finally, Jinghan is the Vice Regent and New Member Educator of Theta Tau.	Jinghan doesn’t know how to have fun, nor does she have the time, so she doesn’t know what else to write in this blurb. The End.			
Liz	Cantlebary		Philanthropy	Liz is a chemical engineering major and went to high school in Park City, Utah. When she's not crying to Kanha in Duffield or getting bubble tea with Julia, Liz is probably dying at the gym or at office hours.	On campus, she's involved in research, the Cornell Daily Sun, and is an RA for Eco-house. Liz is interested in sustainable energy development and hopes to get her MBA after working as a disposable engineer for a few years.	When she's not working, you can join Liz in eating vegetarian food, doing yoga, reading instead of studying, and hanging out with the best class.	(the Xi class. That's the best class.)

Matthew	Danbury		Marketing Chair	Matt is a junior from LaGrange, IL pursuing a degree in engineering physics with minors in materials science and applied mathematics. His main interests lie in the research and development of functional quantum materials which he will pursue by way of a Ph.D. in experimental condensed matter physics. He has had the fortune to tackle these sorts of problems as member of the Kourkoutis Lab on campus, and at the University of Minnesota and Argonne National Laboratory this past summer as an REU fellow.	Matt is a BIG fan of nature, both the esteemed publication as well as that stuff you find outdoors. Matt loves to cook for himself and for others. Matt has figured out how to navigate the entire physical sciences complex such that he only ever has to walk down stairs. Matt is adamant in his claim that VISST 2000 is the single best course offered at Cornell. If Matt could add another nose on the palm of his hand, he would! Just think of all the advantages it would bestow to his culinary exploits, not to mention the added dimensionality in his firm handshakes...					
Kanha	Matai		Intramural Chair	From a land far far away, Kanha is a sophomore EnvE major. Born and raised in a country with the most diverse flora and fauna in the world, Indonesia, he has developed a passion for the environment, sustainability and nature. Thanks to long history of keeping reef aquarium, Kanha has the ability to identify many coral and fish. He’s even started comparing the Xi class to coral species. For example, Collin is a green star polyp. You can ask Collin to explain why. 	Over the summer, Kanha interned in Bali, where he worked with a five star hotel chain to help make them zero waste to landfill. On campus, he is a sub-team lead for AguaClara and is involved in the training of retrievers and shepherds with Guiding Eyes for the Blind. Despite this, you can almost always find him in Duffield.	Kanha is big fan of coffee, which is why he’s always attempting to get people to join him on his far too frequent runs to Gimme. He often creates impromptu plans to get bubble tea with Julia and Liz, or convinces people to join him on random trips to watch movies at the Regal Cinema.				
Collin	Montag		Webmaster	Collin is a sophomore from Basking Ridge, NJ studying CS and minoring in OR. If he could, he'd also study political science, quantum physics, and theoretical math, but unfortunately having four majors isn't exactly a path to graduating.	Last summer, he worked at PVSC, an EPA water treatment facility, where he <del>cleaned the sewers</del> programmed and managed network security in their IT department.	All engineering aside, Collin loves music. He's played classical and ragtime piano for fourteen years and helps give lessons on campus through the Cornell Piano Society. He also sings with the Conell Glee Club and, as their webmaster and TT webmaster, hopes to one day completely own the internet. If you're ever looking for some good classical pieces, don't hesitate to ask!	When he's not "studying" in Duffield, you can find Collin practicing in Lincoln, working on one of his many software ventures, or devouring hummus like a fiend (he swears it's his Turkish blood). He does taekwondo and boxing and firmly believes everyone should ice skate at least once in their life. He also enjoys the company of his fellow Brothers™ and has a lot of experience dealing with Kanha, so feel free to reach out if he ever gives you any trouble.			
Francis	Rayos Del Sol		Diversity and Inclusivity Chair	Francis is a junior from New York City pursuing a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Business.	On campus, apart from being Diversity and Inclusion Chair for Theta Tau, Francis is a part of the Analysis Subteam for Cornell Concrete Canoe and is an Engineering Ambassador. He also works part-time in the Engineering Admissions Office.	In the past, he has interned at a health and wellness startup in New York City with their Sales and Operations team and has tutored mathematics and computer science for middle school students. Next summer, he will be working as a Global Data Summer Analyst at Bloomberg LP.	On a more professional note, he is interested in the cross-section between engineering, business, and design and hopes to make an impact on underrepresented minority communities, specifically the Asian American, first-generation, and disabled individual communities. On a less professional note, in his spare time (what a concept, right?) he likes to spend his time kayaking, aspiring to be a digital photographer, drinking coffee, and discovering new music.
