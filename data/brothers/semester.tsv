Angela	Loh		Academics Chair			
Obi	Abii		Intramural Chair	I'm a rising-Junior CS major with a passion for psychology. I love learning about new things and new people. I have been involved in a lot of HCI research and am currently working in a psych lab with a focus on intuitive technology and toys for two year olds. I love cooking, board games and long walks. I plan to pursue a PHD and maybe become a professor if I play my cards right. I really loved 3110 and am always down to talk about it :) 					
Ling	Cao		Webmaster	Ling is a junior from New York City studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering and pursuing minors in Business and Information Science.	Last summer, she worked as a software engineer intern at NeuralPositive and a product design intern at StartupTree. On campus, she is an active member of Cornell Steel Bridge project team, Engineering Career Fair Team, and her social sorority.

Julia	Timko		Diversity & Inclusion Chair	Julia is a former CivE, former AEP, current junior MechE, and future engineering dropout from Brooklyn, New York.	This past summer, she went home to spend time with her family, work as a counselor at her climbing gym, and avoid interacting with people she doesn’t like. 	On campus, she splits her time between the Organic Robotics Lab where she studies the robotic applications of bioluminescent algae and the Temple of Zeus where she people-watches and plays a game called: “Are They A Sorority Girl or A Co-op Member?” 	She is also excited to be a first-time facilitator for Cornell’s Intergroup Dialogue Project, a class that allows students to connect across difference. She believes the communication skills developed in this course are crucial to good relationships. She’s hoping that expanding her knowledge base into other academic disciplines will better prepare her for the mid-life crisis she plans to have at 35 when she realizes she's sick of engineering. 	As the former NME for Spring 2019, she's proud to see her TT children off slaying their new EBoard positions. She looks forward to meeting the next class and teaching them to take themselves less seriously. 	
Jonna	Chen		Marketing Chair	Jonna is a sophomore from Ithaca and Singapore majoring in Computer Science, with an interest in designing and developing consumer-facing technology for community impact.		Last summer, she was a Software Engineering Intern at WAY, a startup implementing contactless food ordering (via those funky QR codes on a few Collegetown restaurants). She was also a Research Intern at the Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab at Cornell.		On campus, she is the Vice President of Brand for Women in Computing at Cornell. She also writes about first world engineering student problems and attempts to justify why light mode is better than dark mode in her Cornell Daily Sun column, jonna.write().		In her free time, she can be found rewatching Brooklyn 99, lounging on the slope, adding to her quality memes folder on her desktop, or editing a recent vlog (no, she is not a YouTuber). Or if she's hangry, she's probably treating herself to a Green Tea Yakult (pearls and less ice) and a plate of Hainanese chicken rice straight from Singapore.
