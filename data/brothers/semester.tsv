Lindsey	Frank		Professional Development Chair	Lindsey is a Junior from Wayne, NJ studying Mechanical Engineering with interests in the Aerospace, Automotive, and Oil Industries.	On campus she is a suspension sub-team member of the Cornell FSAE Racing Project Team, a defensive player for the Lady Bears Club Volleyball team, and currently serving as one of the Professional Development Chairs for Theta Tau.	This past summer Lindsey interned at Phillips 66 at the Bayway Refinery in Linden, NJ as a Maintenance Engineering Intern on the Fixed Equipment and Reliability Team. Next summer, you can find her again on the Refinery as a Project Engineering Intern in the Small Capital Projects Group.	When she's not working in Duffield you can find her playing board games, crafting, discovering new foods, frolicking with Katrina and laughing at her bad jokes (and being clingy because this is Katrinaâ€™s last semester), chasing dogs around campus, eating at Keeton Tuesdays with Kyra, or acing Francis and digging his hits on the volleyball court.	
Brian	Guo		Professional Development Chair					
Kyra	Conroy		Rush Chair	Kyra Conroy is a sophomore from Naperville, IL studying Operations Research Engineering. 	Last summer, Kyra worked as an Industrial Engineer at Ideal Industries. At Ideal, her main projects were to improve ergonomic packaging, redesign cell structure, conduct time studies, and implement automatic data acquisition technologies. She also attended ThinkChicago, a program designed for exposure and immersion to Chicago's growing tech scene and spent a week facilitating the J Kyle Braid Leadership Program. 	On campus, Kyra is an Odyssey Guide, Ambassador, Education Lead for Spark, Trail Running Teacher and AEW Facilitator. Most importantly, she is the self-designated Morale Chair for the best Theta Tau pledge class - the Mu pledge class.	Outside of these involvements, you can find Kyra running late at night in a construction vest, making crafts, or taking care of her godchild - Llama the rabbit.

Celine	Choo		Webmaster	Celine is a sophomore studying computer science, hoping to minor in English and linguistics. While she may or may not be approximately 23.6% sure of what she wants to do with her life, Celine would like to pursue a career in Something To Do With Linguistics and Computer Science (for now), though her list of hobbies to follow up on is endless (publishing a book, running a small cafe, backpack traveling around the world with a camera, writing a screenplay, etc.).	When she is not (1) attempting to write a story/poem/essay, (2) sleeping at odd hours, (3) looking at memes (shamefully), or (4) watching Buzzfeed videos (also shamefully), you can find her in Carpenter basement working on Cornell Cup or pulling all-nighters working on psets she should have started three days earlier.	Above all, she loves any creative art (including programming). And Black Mirror. Also check out Google Blockly -- the product she worked on last summer!
