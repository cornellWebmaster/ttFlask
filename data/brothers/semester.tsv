When she's not working in Duffield you can find her playing board games, crafting, discovering new foods, frolicking with Katrina and laughing at her bad jokes (and being clingy because this is Katrinaâ€™s last semester), chasing dogs around campus, eating at Keeton Tuesdays with Kyra, or acing Francis and digging his hits on the volleyball court.

Celine	Choo		Webmaster	Celine is a sophomore from Holmdel, NJ studying computer science with (hopeful) minors in English and linguistics. (Adding philosophy and film studies was too much so she stopped there.)	Currently, her professional interest is in natural language processing (with 35.6% certainty). Because her passion is in writing, she is very interested in the cross between the arts/humanities and mathematical/logical thinking.	When she is not (1) attempting to write a story/poem/essay, (2) sleeping at odd hours, (3) laughing at memes (shamefully), or (4) watching Buzzf**d (also shamefully), you can find her in Carpenter basement working on Cornell Cup or pulling all-nighters working on psets she should have started three days earlier.	Engineering aside, Celine aspires to publish a book and/or write a screenplay (or for SNL) in the far-off future. Also check out Google Blockly -- the project she worked on last summer!
