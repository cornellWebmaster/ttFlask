Joe	Wetzel		New Member Educator
Jinghan	Zhang		New Member Educator	Jinghan is a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in English. She hopes to go to medical school and specialize in reconstructive surgery, but also believes that it is foolish to have hopes.	For the past few summers, Jinghan hasn't stepped foot out of Ithaca because she lives in her research laboratory. This past summer was especially titillating because she studied for the MCAT and turned into a hermit, but without any of the advantages, such as leading a carefree existence.	On campus, Jinghan works in the Brito Lab, where she grows bacteria, which is as delectable as it sounds. She is a TA for BIOMG 3300. Additionally, she is the Structures Lead for Design Build Fly, a project team that designs, builds, and flies airplanes. Very self-explanatory. Finally, Jinghan is the Vice Regent and New Member Educator of Theta Tau.	Jinghan doesn’t know how to have fun, nor does she have the time, so she doesn’t know what else to write in this blurb. The End.			
Liz	Cantlebary		Philanthropy	Liz is a chemical engineering major and went to high school in Park City, Utah. When she's not crying to Kanha in Duffield or getting bubble tea with Julia, Liz is probably dying at the gym or at office hours.	On campus, she's involved in research, the Cornell Daily Sun, and is an RA for Eco-house. Liz is interested in sustainable energy development and hopes to get her MBA after working as a disposable engineer for a few years.	When she's not working, you can join Liz in eating vegetarian food, doing yoga, reading instead of studying, and hanging out with the best class.	(the Xi class. That's the best class.)			
Marc	Antonios		Professional Development Chair
Emma	Renner		Professional Development Chair	Emma Renner is a Junior from Round Hill, VA, studying Mechanical Engineering. Her career aspirations include working on the Mission to Mars, focusing on resource sustainability.

She also is a research assistant working on hydroponic systems in Cornell Greenhouses. Additionally she is an Outdoor Odyssey Guide, teaches sea kayaking for COE, and is VP of Cornell Outing Club.	This past summer, Emma worked as a Wilderness Ranger in Montreat, North Carolina. She led public hikes, maintained hiking trails, and assisted with wildlife conservation and wrangled snakes.	Emma is a self-proclaimed dessert connoisseur and mountain enthusiast. When not studying in Duffield, Emma can be found playing Settlers of Catan, hanging with the women of Mu, listening to NPR and swing dancing in various places.

Priyanka	Konan		Recruitment Chair
Kyra	Conroy		Social Chair	Kyra is a junior from Naperville, IL studying Operations Research with a minor in Dyson.	On campus she is involved in Outdoor Odyssey, Ambassadors, Spark, and teaching the Trail Running COE course, as well as the current Social (and Mu Morale) Chair for TT.	She interned as an Industrial Engineer for IDEAL Industries after freshman year, and this summer, at Bosch, she worked in the consulting group on digital strategy.	When not on late-night runs in her reflective construction vest, you can find her crafting, singing, grazing with her woMUn, or watching sunsets in Rhodes. Her career interests lie in education, chicago, patagonia, technology, and being a good human.			
Michael	Xiao		Social Chair	Michael Xiao is a junior from Blacksburg, Virginia, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. On campus, he is a subteam lead within the Biofuels project team, Vice President of Communications of Engineers for a Sustainable World, and an Autodesk campus ambassador. Michael is also heavily involved in research in the Shepherd Lab, where he studies the application and design of soft robotics.	This past summer, Michael interned at Proctor and Gamble in Cincinnati where he worked on augmented reality, power systems, and biometric authentication. He hopes to pursue a career in product design, tech, or management.	Outside of the classroom, he enjoys rock climbing, cooking, and arts and crafts.				
Chelsea	Han		Alumni Relations Chair
Christopher	Wright		Academics Chair	Chris is a junior from Rochester, NY studying mechanical engineering.	In addition to academics chair, Chris is president of Energy@Cornell, the thermoelectric generation sub-team lead of ChemE Car and is active in his social fraternity.	Last summer, Chris worked as a mechanical design intern at Teknic, where he optimized the production process of integrated servo motors. He also does freelance work building domino chain reactions for advertisments, trade shows and museums and has worked with companies such as Microsoft, Disney, Gillete and Pizza Hut.	Chris also enjoys lifting, reading, Pokeland and learning new things.			
Matthew	Danbury		Marketing Chair	Matt is a junior from LaGrange, IL pursuing a degree in engineering physics with minors in materials science and applied mathematics. His main interests lie in the research and development of functional quantum materials which he will pursue by way of a Ph.D. in experimental condensed matter physics. He has had the fortune to tackle these sorts of problems as member of the Kourkoutis Lab on campus, and at the University of Minnesota and Argonne National Laboratory this past summer as an REU fellow.	Matt is a BIG fan of nature, both the esteemed publication as well as that stuff you find outdoors. Matt loves to cook for himself and for others. Matt has figured out how to navigate the entire physical sciences complex such that he only ever has to walk down stairs. Matt is adamant in his claim that VISST 2000 is the single best course offered at Cornell. If Matt could add another nose on the palm of his hand, he would! Just think of all the advantages it would bestow to his culinary exploits, not to mention the added dimensionality in his firm handshakes...					
Kanha	Matai		Intramural Chair
Collin	Montag		Webmaster	Collin is a sophomore from Basking Ridge, NJ studying CS and minoring in OR. If he could, he'd also study politcal science, quantum physics, and theoretical math, but unfortunately having four majors isn't exactly a path to graduating.	Last summer, he worked at PVSC, an EPA water treatment facility, <del>cleaning the sewers</del> programming and managing network security in their IT department.	All engineering aside, Collin loves music. He's played classical and ragtime piano for fourteen years and helps give lessons on campus through the Cornell Piano Society. He also sings with the Conell Glee Club and, as their webmaster and TT webmaster, hopes to one day completely own the internet. If you're ever looking for some good classical pieces, don't hesitate to ask!	When he's not "studying" in Duffield, you can find Collin practicing in Lincoln, working on one of his many software ventures, or devouring hummus like a fiend (he swears it's his Turkish blood). He does taekwondo and boxing and firmly believes everyone should ice skate at least once in their life. He also enjoys the company of his fellow Brothers™ and has a lot of experience dealing with Kanha, so feel free to reach out if he ever gives you any trouble.			
Francis	Rayos Del Sol		Diversity and Inclusivity Chair	Francis is a junior from New York City pursuing a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Business.	On campus, apart from being Diversity and Inclusion Chair for Theta Tau, Francis is a part of the Analysis Subteam for Cornell Concrete Canoe and is an Engineering Ambassador. He also works part-time in the Engineering Admissions Office.	In the past, he has interned at a health and wellness startup in New York City with their Sales and Operations team and has tutored mathematics and computer science for middle school students. Next summer, he will be working as a Global Data Summer Analyst at Bloomberg LP.	On a more professional note, he is interested in the cross-section between engineering, business, and design and hopes to make an impact on underrepresented minority communities, specifically the Asian American, first-generation, and disabled individual communities. On a less professional note, in his spare time (what a concept, right?) he likes to spend his time kayaking, aspiring to be a digital photographer, drinking coffee, and discovering new music.
