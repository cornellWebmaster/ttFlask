This semester, Kanha is currently a Data Analyst Intern in a building energy efficiency company in Ithaca as part of the COOP program. He is currently getting the best of all worlds; participating in an internship, while remaining in Ithaca, without taking any classes.	Kanha is big fan of coffee, which is why he's always attempting to get people to join him for a cup of coffee from his endless collection of coffee. He often creates impromptu plans to get Gimme Coffee with Julia, Liz and Anuj, or convinces people (particularly Emma) to join him on random trips to far locations.

On campus, she is the battery team lead for the Cornell ChemE Car project team, from back when she had high aspirations to be a ChemE. She is also looking into research into how public services, driven and organized by algorithmic systems, can shape social inequalities. Her professional interests lie in understanding how data-driven public technologies affect social climates, but you may get a different answer if you ask her tomorrow.	When she is not found hunched over a table in Upson, you can find her people watching, cooking, playing the violin, fermenting (not as weird as it sounds, she promises), watching all the Bon Appetit YouTube videos, eating all of the food in her sorority house, and missing her dog.
